## Overview

This project builds an end-to-end sentiment analysis pipeline for Urdu social media texts, targeting platforms like Twitter and YouTube. It classifies text into **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** sentiments, helping brands and businesses interpret feedback in Urdu.

---

## Features

1. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Custom stopword removal with sentiment retention  
   - Text cleaning (punctuation, URLs, emojis, hashtags)  
   - Emoji-to-sentiment mapping  
   - Filtering posts shorter than three words  

2. **Morphological Processing**
   - Urdu stemming  
   - Urdu lemmatization  

3. **Feature Extraction**
   - Tokenization for Urdu text  
   - TF‚ÄìIDF vectorization with top-term extraction  
   - Word2Vec embedding model with similarity queries  

4. **N‚ÄëGram Analysis**
   - Extraction of unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams  
   - Frequency-based ranking of top 10 for bigrams/trigrams  

5. **Sentiment Classification**
   - Multinomial Naive Bayes using TF‚ÄìIDF features  
   - Evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score  

---

## Dataset

Uses a publicly available Urdu social media dataset (e.g., Kaggle‚Äôs Urdu Twitter Sentiment Dataset).  
Ensure the dataset CSV includes:
- `urdu_text`: raw Urdu post
- `is_sarcastic`: sentiment label (`0`, `1`, etc.)  
*(Adapt columns if using another dataset.)*

---

## Installation


git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/urdu-sentiment-analysis.git
cd urdu-sentiment-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt

## requirements.txt:
pandas
nltk
gensim
scikit-learn
emoji
LughaatNLP

---

## Usage
Place data file (e.g. urdu_sarcasm_dataset.csv) into the project directory.
Execute the main notebook or script:

Step through Phases 1‚Äì6 to observe:
Preprocessing
Feature extraction (TF‚ÄìIDF, Word2Vec)
N‚Äëgram counts
Model training & evaluation

## Pipeline Details
Phase	Description
1	Text cleaning, stopwords, emojis, URL/hashtag removal
2	Urdu-specific stemming/lemmatization
3	Tokenization, TF‚ÄìIDF vectorization, Word2Vec model
4	N‚Äëgram frequency analysis
5	Classifier training (Multinomial Naive Bayes)
6	Model evaluation: accuracy, precision, recall, F1
---
## Evaluation
Example results from the test set:
Accuracy: 75.7%
Precision: 70.7%
Recall: 90.9%
F1‚ÄëScore: 79.5%
(Modify with your actual results.)
---

## Challenges
Complex Urdu morphology (gender, tense, plurality)
Rich colloquial expressions and phonetic spellings
Noisy social media data (misspellings, emojis, short posts)
Limited pre-trained resources for Urdu

---

## Future Work
Incorporate contextual embeddings (e.g., multilingual BERT/XLM)
Expand dataset with more varied social media sources
Refine preprocessing for phonetic spellings and code-switching
Compare performance across classifiers (SVM, deep learning)

### ‚úÖ What to Do Next

- Create the repo named **`urdu-sentiment-analysis`**.
- Add your notebook, include a `requirements.txt`, possibly a sample dataset or instructions to download one.
- Paste the `README.md` above into your repo root and fill in any missing details (dataset source, actual metrics, etc.).

Happy coding‚Äîand best of luck showcasing your Urdu sentiment analysis work! üòä
